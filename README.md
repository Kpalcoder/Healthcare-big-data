## Data Extraction from ClinicalTrials.gov

This project provides a streamlined interface to extract and interact with the vast repository of clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFCGZpk47cF73bNDyaEXuKiJ-IpmJEgR3szCIcy_2a3CM7bFZlGAJV9YE5dqfBag4vCrzMWl4amXkaTiMR480m_b17cszQ7s49JKRqHZOOXjhyxuLyKHPjS26F4QsxmUpSmIxLA-1NED6AzTw%3D%3D)]

Harnessing the power of the official open-source API, this tool is designed for researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in the landscape of clinical studies worldwide.

### üéØ About The Project

ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFCGZpk47cF73bNDyaEXuKiJ-IpmJEgR3szCIcy_2a3CM7bFZlGAJV9YE5dqfBag4vCrzMWl4amXkaTiMR480m_b17cszQ7s49JKRqHZOOXjhyxuLyKHPjS26F4QsxmUpSmIxLA-1NED6AzTw%3D%3D)] This project simplifies the process of programmatically accessing this data. Whether you're conducting a meta-analysis, tracking the progress of trials in a specific therapeutic area, or building applications that leverage clinical trial information, this tool is for you.

A new version of the ClinicalTrials.gov API (v2.0) has been released, offering a more modern and standardized way to access the data.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEyalRYkQQ9CCTOEuHkzsvrUOmCVw9SzSEJRYAlvYXZs38KCxr6wsKQLJ4hsspG-bthXO8rGPTm0xr7GSGabybGV8SgLH-Jq1IMsztj8qqitJpVGQhZeNXDQ6ruJjC7qdNfJll5JmHp5w1A8vmN7FyYMgyV9A0aV9bpOFqUwcDQ673E)] This project is built to utilize the latest features of this new API.

### ‚ú® Key Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how you can use this tool to find clinical trials related to Diabetes:

```python
from clinical_trials_extractor import ClinicalTrials

# Initialize the client
ct = ClinicalTrials()

# Search for studies with the condition "Diabetes"
diabetes_studies = ct.search(query="Diabetes", max_studies=50)

# Print the NCT ID and brief title of each study
for study in diabetes_studies:
    nct_id = study['protocolSection']['identificationModule'].get('nctId', 'N/A')
    brief_title = study['protocolSection']['identificationModule'].get('briefTitle', 'N/A')
    print(f"{nct_id}: {brief_title}")

```

For more advanced queries and data fields, please refer to the [official API documentation](https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/guides/getting-started).

### üìä Data

The data extracted through this tool comes directly from the ClinicalTrials.gov database. The data structure is based on the JSON format provided by the API and includes a wide range of information for each study, such as:

*   Study identifiers (NCT ID)
*   Study status (recruiting, completed, etc.)
*   Conditions and interventions
*   Eligibility criteria
*   Locations and contact information
*   Study results (if available)
